Todo:

Backend stuff:
    - functionality to save / load a backup file
    - check all streams for closure

Stuff before release:
    - option to remove all custom items
    - add banner in navigation view

    - frontend for sharing
    - re adjust color scheme for blue accent color
    - consistent fontSizes for titles, content, etc
    - two textFields for birthdayHolder

    - option to change language
    - think about translation of tag lists and templates
    - add basic items of all categories to list
    - replace all colors and values like text size with resource references




Add after release:
    - WeekPlanner / Calendar
    - decide what to do with terms in the past, (delete after week? even show them at all?)
    - button to go to current day in DayView

    - option to remember fragment (in navigation settings)
    - option to default to a specific fragment
    - option to choose which icons are where (in bottom navigation)

    - figure out how to preload sleep fragment without disappearing custom days

Ideas:
    - if year in the future is set, set birthday info text to ("will be born in... years")
    - update birthdayfragment and birthdaypanel home when 00:00 is passed
    - scroll buffer f√ºr notes??
    - dark themed notes?
    - functionality that supports adding of categories?
    - make shopping list presets save and loadable
    - suggested amount for shopping items
    - add tags / sublist for different store/s?
