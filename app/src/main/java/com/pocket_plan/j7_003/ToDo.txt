Todo:

Back-End stuff before release:

    - functionality to save / load a backup file
    - check all streams for closure

Front-End stuff to-do before release in following order:
    - 2 color birthday months?
    - 2 color birthday years?

    - 3 Finish ItemList and TagList in german
    - 3 Translate ItemList and TagList to english

    - 4 think about how to handle different language item lists (change after existing list?)


    - 2 FrontEnd / for sharing

    - 1 add banner in navigation view

    - 2 final code cleanup



Add after release:
    - let user pick custom note color?
    - Front-End / Back-End ? option to change language
    - Add more languages
    - WeekPlanner / Calendar
    - decide what to do with terms in the past, (delete after week? even show them at all?)
    - button to go to current day in DayView

    - option to remember fragment (in navigation settings)
    - option to default to a specific fragment
    - option to choose which icons are where (in bottom navigation)

    - figure out how to preload sleep fragment without disappearing custom days
    - detect keyboard close in editor and clear focus

Ideas:
    - if year in the future is set, set birthday info text to ("will be born in... years")
    - update birthdayFragment and birthdayPanel home when 00:00 is passed
    - scroll buffer f√ºr notes??
    - dark themed notes?
    - functionality that supports adding of categories?
    - make shopping list presets save and loadable
