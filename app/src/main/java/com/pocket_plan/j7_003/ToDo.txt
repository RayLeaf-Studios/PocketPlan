Todo:

backend stuff:
    - functionality to save / load a backup file?

Stuff to get done today:
    - scrollbuffer fÃ¼r notes, shopping, task, birthdays
    - detect year change in birthday add/edit => check save year
    - undo shopping fragment
    - implement only one add button that does not reload when switching fragments

Priority 1 tasks:
    - add basic items of all categories to list
    - language options

Priority 2 tasks:
    - functionality that supports adding of categories?
    - darkthemed notes?
    - button to open sidebar menu?
    - replace all colors and values like text size with resource references


Ideas:
    - make shopping list presets save and loadable
    - suggested amount for shopping items
    - add tags / sublist for different store/s?

Add after release:
    - WeekPlanner / Calendar
    - decide what to do with terms in the past, (delete after week? even show them at all?)
    - button to go to current day in DayView
