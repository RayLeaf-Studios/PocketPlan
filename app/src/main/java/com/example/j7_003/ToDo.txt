        - api created preloaded database of items, tagged with category like vegetables? for grouping
        of similar items on shopping list for optimal pathing through supermarket
        logical categories
            1. vegetables, fruits
            2. cooled meat
            3. cooled dairy products
            4. canned food
            5. bread and pastry
            6. pasta, rice
            7. spices
            8. hygiene
            9. drinks
            10. alcoholic drinks
            11. international

    6 Notes

    7 MainPanel

Stuff to do next in following order:
     - home panel design
     - single term design in calendar view

important Tasks:
    - fix loading of numberpickers in sleepfragment
    - fix remaining wake time string for every occasion (bis zur wakeup time, verbal ins bett schicken)
    - sleepReminder alarms should be set once and refresh on trigger (Sent intent extra to notification receiver)
    - update sleepReminder to calculate the remaining duration until the next reminder and reset to the next after the wake up time

random tasks:
    - add listener to number picker for typing in numbers
    - add support for 24h sleep duration
    - live update sleep-reminder time
    - design home panel
    - add shopping list module
    - plan calendar layout
    - replace all colors and values like text size with resource references

ideas:
    - week-schedule: display current day in the home screen
    - maybe make modules more customizable
    - make months somehow visible in birthday fragment
    - make note column count flexible (1-3)
    - maybe change note background to look like index card
    - delete notes by press and hold (mark multiple)
