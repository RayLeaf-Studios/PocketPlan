Todo:

Priority 1 tasks:
    - finalize shopping contents / colors

Priority 2 tasks:
    - rename repository to pocket-plan
    - git ignore .idea folder?
    - change birthday date pickers to actual date pickers
      make all spinners / dropDowns / autoTextViews darkTheme
    - option to save year for birthday, tap birthday to expand more info, (how many days until?),
      Display age in notification? e.g. "Max turns 20 today!"

Priority 3 tasks:
    - add new icon
    - replace all colors and values like text size with resource references
    - annotations to use different serialized / displayed variable names
    - birthday undo insert animation
    - figure out if its possible to shrink category list without reloading when
      deleting an item
    - figure out how to put the icon in the appbar without resulting in long loading times when
        switching to home panel (this only occurs on devices, not in the emulator!)


Ideas:
    - make shopping list presets save and loadable
    - suggested amount for shopping items
    - add tags / sublist for different store/s?


Add after release:
    - WeekPlanner / Calendar
    - decide what to do with terms in the past, (delete after week? even show them at all?)
    - button to go to current day in DayView
