Todo:

Priority 1 tasks:
    - fix crashing tasks when deleting via mass delete and quickly swipe deleting a task
    - allow users to put already known items into different categories (and remember this decision)

Priority 2 tasks:
    - remove scroll when checking / modifying tasks
    - change layout without refreshing when swipe deleting item from shopping list (when all are
      checked)
    - change birthday date pickers to actual date pickers
      make all spinners / dropDowns / autoTextViews darkTheme
    - birthday undo insert animation
    - make birthdays searchable
    - option to save year for birthday, tap birthday to expand more info, (how many days until?),
      Display age in notification? e.g. "Max turns 20 today!"

Priority 3 tasks:
    - add new icon
    - replace all colors and values like text size with resource references
    - annotations to use different serialized / displayed variable names


Ideas:
    - make shopping list presets save and loadable
    - suggested amount for shopping items
    - small counter for accomplished tasks of taskList
    - add tags / sublist for different store/s?



Add after release:
    - WeekPlanner / Calendar
    - decide what to do with terms in the past, (delete after week? even show them at all?)
    - button to go to current day in DayView
